# mlops_zoomcamp2025
This project focuses on implementing MLOps practices for machine learning workflows. Key accomplishments include:

- Setting up a reproducible development environment.
- Automating data preprocessing and model training pipelines.
- Deploying machine learning models using CI/CD workflows.
- Monitoring model performance in production.
- Documenting the entire process for scalability and collaboration.

The repository contains code, configurations, and documentation to help replicate and adapt these practices.
